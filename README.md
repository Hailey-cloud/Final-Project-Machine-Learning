## 🔄 GitHub Workflow Overview

1. **🔀 Branch Creation**: Team member should work on the branch developed in each other's branch.
2. **✅ Pull Requests**: Team members submit PRs for review and feedback.
3. **🔄 Merging**: Only reviewed and approved PRs are merged into the `main` branch.
4. **🔄 Merging2**: In the process of working on it, the code was quite different from the main file, so we are uploading the final version as a separate file to avoid conflicts.

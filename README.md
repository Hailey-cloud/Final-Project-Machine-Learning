## 🔄 GitHub Workflow Overview

1. **🔀 Branch Creation**: Each module (e.g., preprocessing, training, visualization) is developed in its own feature branch.
2. **✅ Pull Requests**: Team members submit PRs for review and feedback.
3. **🔄 Merging**: Only reviewed and approved PRs are merged into the `main` branch.

> Naming convention: `feature/model-training`, `bugfix/missing-values`, etc.
